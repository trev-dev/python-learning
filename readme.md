# Python presentations & slides


<a id="org80de6a1"></a>

## What is this repository?

This is a repository that contains python lectures, slides & exercises for my Python basics course modules. You may either view them using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) or by simply opening the corresponding slides.html within each folder. It's purpose is to guide a lecture on the basics of Python and provide context & examples.

## Where's the solutions to the exercises?

They will be in a separate repository and made available after this repository is more or less complete.

## May I use this repository?

You are 100% free to use, fork, change and reproduce this content. All I ask for is the occassional plug.

If you want to use these slides with all of their interactive glory in Jupyter Notebook, you will need to use the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) extension. Both Jupyter Nodebook and RISE can be installed by following directions for various Linux distros or your other OS of choice (Mac/Windows).

## May I contribute to this repository?

You may, though, keep in mind that I have a set order for these course modules. I will need to merge changes at my discretion.

## What's included

Also note this repository is a <span class="underline">work in progress</span>. I am building and refining it as I go. Check back or perform a \`git pull\` periodically to get updates.
